### About Myself:
With 5+ years of experience as a TV journalist (reporter and producer), I've decided to switch my career drastically. This decision came in the wake of the pandemic and changes in people's daily lives.<br>

I aspire to get a position as a Data Analyst in the future. But I realize that I lack experience and knowledge in the area. That's why I'm in the process of self-learning the basics of Python and data analysis and its practical implementation.<br>

However, the long self-educating path I'm taking shouldn't prevent me from getting an entry-level job. Thus, I'm looking for a position as a Junior Frontend Developer. I'm eager to learn and develop in the digital industry, and I believe my previous experience in researching and analyzing data can help me in this. <br>
